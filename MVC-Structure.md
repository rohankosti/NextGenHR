MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture in Node.js is a software design pattern used to organize code into three interconnected layers, promoting separation of concerns and improved maintainability for scalable applications. In this pattern, Models manage data and business logic, Views handle the user interface (often using template engines), and Controllers act as the intermediary, handling user requests, updating models, and returning views. 

Core Components of Node.js MVC:

Model: Represents the data and business rules. It manages the state of the application and interacts with the database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB via Mongoose or Sequelize).
View: The user interface that displays data. In traditional Node.js MVC, this is rendered on the server using template engines like EJS, Pug, or Handlebars. In modern APIs, the view might just be JSON sent to a frontend framework.

Controller: The brain of the application. It handles incoming HTTP requests, invokes Model methods to fetch or update data, and selects a View to render. 
Implementation Workflow

Request: A user interaction (e.g., clicking a button, submitting a form) reaches the server.

Routing: The router directs the request to the appropriate controller.
Controller Processing: The controller processes the request, potentially calls the model to update data.
Model Update: The model performs database operations.

View Generation: The controller receives the data from the model and passes it to the view template.
Response: The final HTML or JSON is sent back to the user. 
Example Structure (Express.js)
A typical Node.js/Express MVC project structure is organized by feature rather than type:

Benefits of MVC in Node.js
. Separation of Concerns: Clearly separates logic, data, and presentation, making code easier to manage.
. Scalability: Facilitates the development of large-scale, complex applications.
. Parallel Development: Team members can work on different components (e.g., backend logic vs. UI     
  independently.
. Testability: Each component can be tested independently. 
. Popular Frameworks for MVC in Node
. While Express.js is the most popular minimalist framework often used to build MVC structures, other     
  frameworks specifically designed for this pattern exist: 
. Sails.js: Highly popular MVC framework for enterprise-grade applications.
. NestJS: Often uses a controller-service-repository structure similar to MVC.
. Hapi.js: Used for building robust applications, often integrated with ORMs like Sequelize.

⭐ Short Interview Answer
“EJS is used in views to generate dynamic HTML on the server using backend data. It allows loops, conditions, and variable rendering inside HTML, which is not possible in plain HTML. This helps in SEO, fast rendering, and building server-driven pages.”

📌 Final Summary (one-line answers):-
MVC = Code ko 3 parts me divide kar ke clean, maintainable aur scalable banata hai.
Routes = URL ko controller ke sath map karte hai.
Model = Database handle karta hai.
Views use → jab server-side HTML chahiye.
Controller = Logic handle karta hai.
